2048bot
=======

A simple and stupid bot for 2048 game (http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

### How it works

At the moment bot simply choses the step that will result in the
largest number of free cells. If there are many steps that lead to the
same maximum number of free cells, step direction is randomly chosen.
